# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application should be **approved or rejected** based on various applicant details such as income, loan amount, credit history, dependents, and employment status.  
It demonstrates how **Machine Learning** can help financial institutions automate and improve loan decision processes.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Build a classification model that analyzes applicant data and predicts the likelihood of loan approval, helping reduce manual effort and lending risk.

---

## 🧩 Dataset
- **File Name:** `Finance.csv`
- **Description:** Contains demographic and financial information of loan applicants.
- **Key Features:**
  - `ApplicantIncome`
  - `CoapplicantIncome`
  - `LoanAmount`
  - `Credit_History`
  - `Dependents`
  - `Education`, `Married`, `Self_Employed`, `Gender`
  - `Loan_Status` (Target Variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## 🧠 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized data distributions and correlations using heatmaps and pairplots.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Scaled numerical variables and selected top features affecting loan approval.
4. **Model Building**
   - Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Achieved **~85% model accuracy** in predicting loan approval outcomes.
- **Credit History** and **Applicant Income** are key factors influencing approvals.
- Demonstrates how ML can be applied for **automated loan screening** in banking and fintech sectors.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Use **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance.
- Implement advanced models like **XGBoost** or **LightGBM**.
- Deploy the model using **Streamlit or Flask** for real-time prediction.
